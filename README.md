game-of-life
==============

This repo contains an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) which I am writing to explore and learn the [rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It is a work in progress and exists completely for educational purposes. Have fun!
